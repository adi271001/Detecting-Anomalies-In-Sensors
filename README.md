# Detecting-Anomalies-In-Sensors
We utilise an autoencoder neural network in this workbook to discover vibrational irregularities in a set of bearings using sensor information. The goal is to be able to predict bearing failures in the future before they occur. The NASA Acoustics and Vibration Database provided the vibrational sensor readings. Individual files containing 1-second vibration signal snapshots captured at 10-minute intervals make up each data set. The bearing sensors were read at a sampling rate of 20 kHz, yielding 20,480 sensor data points in each file.Within the Keras / TensorFlow framework, this autoencoder neural network model is generated utilising Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) cells.
